# 3D Printed Cases for LNURLPoS

These 3D print files will print a case for the LNURLPoS device

There is space inside the case for a small battery, a switch and the TTGO display.

These switches will fit in the case. They should be hot glued into place until we have a better solution.

## Printing

The stl/m3u files print best when oriented with the keypad side of the top and the outside of the bottom flat on the print bed. 

Use printing support everywhere with 20% infil.

## Additional Parts

4 x M3 x 5mm screws are required to attach the base to the top.

4 x 5.6mm adhesive rubber feet stop the case sliding around on a work surface - https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/192563250638
