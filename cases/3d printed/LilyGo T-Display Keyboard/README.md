# 3D Printed Cases for LNURLPoS with LilyGo T-Display Keyboard

These 3D print files will print a case for the LilyGo T-Display Keyboard https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003534734992.html.

The keyboard will need to be dismantled to fit it into the case.

When reassembling, the screws that held the back plate on to the keyboard, go through the back of the case as well as the keyboard rear plate to hold the case together.

Use these switches if you want to include a battery for untethered power https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OK9FAUW/
