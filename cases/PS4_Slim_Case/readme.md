This design tries to keep the form factor as small as possible using a 4x3 solid keyboard. There's a designated area for a PS4 controller battery to fit snuggly. There're some improvements possible but this is now fully functional with some tinkering of the keyboard cable routing. The switch should be glued to case for better results.

3 x M2x4x3.5mm threaded inserts are recommended.
