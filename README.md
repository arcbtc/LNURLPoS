Lightning-network uses hot wallets and real-world payments are made from phones. The burden of connectivity can be taken away from the point-of-sale and given to the phone.

LNURLPoS uses the LNURL-pay protocol. LNURL-pay allows your lightning-wallet to make a secure request to a server to get a lightning-network invoice. So instead of scanning a massive ugly lightning-network invoice QR, you can scan a lovely little LNURL QR (if you <a href="https://lnurl.fiatjaf.com/codec/">decode</a> an LNURL you'll see its just a URL).

For online stuff I suppose massive QR codes are not an issue, but when fiddling with hardware devices they are. LNURLPoS using the LNURL-pay protocol, it can use a smaller screen for displaying the QR.

### Setup workflow

- LNURLPoS server set up and register PoS in a few clicks on <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/">LNbits</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/master/lnbits/extensions/lnurlpos">LNURLPoS</a> extension
- Copy credentials (including a secret key) from server to the physical LNURLPoS device

### Payment workflow

- Merchant enters amount into LNURLPoS device
- LNURL is generated in device and displayed for scanning (LNURL includes a unique pin encrypted using the secret key shared with the server)
- Customer scans and pays
- When the payment has cleared the customer is sent the decrypted unique pin
- Merchant can compare and verify using the same pin displayed on the lNURLPoS

- Plug in T-Display, from _Tools>Board>ESP32 Boards_ select **TTGO LoRa32 OLED V1**

> _Note: If using MacOS, you will need the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers available here https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers_

### LNbits extension

To make things easy (usually a few clicks on things like Raspiblitz), there is an <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/master/lnbits/extensions/lnurlpos">LNbits extension</a>.
If you want to make your own stand-alone server software that would be fairly easy to do, by replicating the lnurl.py file in the extennsion.

### Future updates

At the beginning of this article I said "LNURLPoS (currently) only uses LNURL-Pay". The next stage will be for the PoS to also create LNURL-Withdraws, which are essentially faucets. This means merchants can offer refunds, and also sell bitcoin over the counter, which creates an extremely powerful tool for local economies on-ramping and off-ramping from their local fiat currency.

At Adopting Bitcoin in San Salvador I will distribute 40 kits over x2 workshops, so hopefully some locals will start producing, selling and teaching others how to make these useful little units.

## Deeper Dive

### LNURL

Much of the innovation that happens on lightning-network uses an additional protocol layer called LNURL.

LNURL is just a bech32 encoded URL string, that is a link to an LNURL server that your lightning wallet can request information from. By your wallet being able to communicate with a server, developers are no longer bound by the _payee-generate-invoice_ workflow. There are many different types of LNURL. LNURLPoS (currently) only uses LNURL-Pay.

This is an LNURL-pay QR code:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33088785/136535559-7e351bac-781d-4a53-9643-fa8ebcad7aef.png)

This is the data in that QR code:

`LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7MRWVF5HGUEWVDHK6TMVDE6HYMRS9ASHQ6F0WCCJ7MRWW4EXCTECXVUQR8PUDZ`

If we decode the LNURL we get this URL:

`https://lnbits.com/lnurlp/api/v1/lnurl/838`

If you do a GET request to the URL this data will be returned (you can test this by just visiting the URL in a browser):

```
{
  "callback": "https://lnbits.com/lnurlp/api/v1/lnurl/cb/838",
  "maxSendable": 10000000000,
  "metadata": "[[\"text/plain\", \"Lovely little QR\"]]",
  "minSendable": 10000,
  "tag": "payRequest"
}
```

When your wallet gets this json it asks you how much you want to send between the `minSendable` and `maxSendable`.

After a moment you get a “payment sent” confirmation and receipt.

<img style="width:40%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33088785/136538546-cdc64c22-f7b5-44e4-841e-3341f6865687.png">

So what happened?

When you verify you want to send say 10sats, your wallet sends that data (as a json) to the `callback` URL. The server then generates an invoice for that amount and sends it back to your wallet, which pays it. Once the payment has cleared, the wallet reveals a receipt to you.

### LNURLPoS workflow

LNURLPoS generates and encodes the LNURL in the device, which means we can pass some data in the URL.

The LNURLPoS stores four important pieces of data:

- URL to your LNURL server (we’re using an LNbits install, with dedicated extension)
- PoS ID (Unique ID generated in the LNbits extension)
- Secret (Secret shared with the LNURL server)
- Currency denomination (being offline sats becomes too volatile)

LNURLPoS could use any LNURL server that performs some certain functions, but to make things easy I made an extension in LNbits specifically for LNURLPoS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33088785/136534237-d1ec7a3f-7937-43b0-91d7-b5cd9587389b.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33088785/136534873-92d080d5-7825-4358-8dd5-3d04009aa80b.png)

Once a PoS has been generated the extension gives you this data:

```
String server = "https://lnbits.com";
String posId = "L4aJNiQZyPxCREoB3KXiiU";
String key = "4TPLxRmv82yEFjUgWKdfPh";
String currency = "EUR";
```

The data can then be passed to the device when uploading its software through the Arduino IDE

<img style="width:50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33088785/136539934-32b47c21-67c4-44bc-976b-c8ccf399570e.png">

When an amount is entered into the LNURLPoS, the device generates a unique pin, then encrypts the amount+pin using the shared secret and a nonce. The server endpoint, nonce, encypted data, and PoS ID are built into into the LNURL.

`https://lnbits.com/lnurlpos/api/v1/lnurl/<nonce>/<encrypted-data>/<pos-id>`

`LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7MRWVF5HGUEWVDHK6TMVDE6HYMRSDAEJ7CTSDYHHVVF0D3H82UNV9U7XUMMWVDJNUTEUV4HXXUNEWP6X2EPDV3SHGCF79U78QMMN945KG0S2PG6GTWSK`

When that first GET request happens from the wallet, the LNURL server can find the PoS record, fetch its secret use the secret to decrypt the amount+pin. The amount is converted from the fiat currency to sats, and sent back to the wallet as `minSendable` and `maxSendable`.

If the invoice passed to the wallet is paid the customer is given access to the decrypted pin.
